# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Moomoo

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An rpg about a girl going on an adventure to find her lost cat.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I want to first have it show the background of the story featuring moments of the girl and her cat. It will fast forward to the present day when she is waiting to come back from college and see her cat. But she gets home and the cat is missing and she heads out to find her. While trying to find her cat, she gathers clues that lead her to a jealous childhood friend that kidnaped the cat. I haven't really thought of the rest and how she will try to defeat her but I do want the game to end with the player deleting the file of the villain just like in doki doki literature club. One of the features includes the player being able to choose dialogue. The game might need the character to be able to carry inventory.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Working alone.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- The character will be able to start on her adventure to find clues.

Adding NPC characters

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

2 different endings
Being able to include file deleting 
Longer than 20 mins 
More details around the world

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are to research which game engine I want to use. Omori, one of my favorite rpgs uses RPG maker MV but I heard that it uses javascript. If I were to use that then I need to get more familiar with javascript. I don't know how to use RPG maker so I would have to look up youtube tutorials. I am pretty familiar with UNITY since I have used it before so I might use that instead since I can python with it. If all goes to failure, I will change my game from a rpg to a visual novel and I would use Ren'Py. After I decide where I want to create my game, I will start with creating the characters in the game along with creating the world itself. To do so, I would use youtube tutorials if it's not self explanatory.
