Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created the title screen as well as the background slides. I have created the map and the towns. I set up the game's story until the player starts the adventure.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to create an adventure through the forest that includes clues and battles. I also need to work on fighting in the game. I would also need to develop the final fight. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The problem I encountered was if I should use plug-ins and if so, what types. I'm thinking that I may have trouble figuring out how to make the user delete a character out of the data so that they can end the game.
