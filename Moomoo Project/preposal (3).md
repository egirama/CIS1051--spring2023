# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I am set on creating a rpg about a girl going on an adventure to find her lost cat.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Working alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I was thinking of including background music in the game. Is it okay if I include music that my friend produced?
