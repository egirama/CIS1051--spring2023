I had lots of fun creating this project as it allowed me to learn something I never learned before.
I enjoyed how beginner-friendly the game engine RPG maker is.
Something that was a bit difficult was learning how the controls and how to organize the battle scenes.
I overcame those difficulties by watching youtube tutorials.
RPG maker only worked on my pc because of Windows so it was difficult because the internet doesn't work on my pc
This challenged me because it wouldn't let me open up google drive where I stored the soundtrack.
Overall, this project has motivated me to continue working on game development 
I am interested in continuing this project, making it better and better.
